HTML:

- The HTML structure is semantic, using appropriate tags for headings, paragraphs, images, and sections.
- The content is divided into sections, each with a clear purpose (about, skills, projects, resume, contact).
- Images are used to enhance the visual appeal, with alt text for accessibility.

CSS:

- The CSS is written in a separate stylesheet, keeping the HTML clean and focused on content.
- Classes and IDs are used to target specific elements, with a consistent naming convention.
- Styles are applied to create a visually appealing layout, with a focus on readability and usability.

JavaScript:

- JavaScript is not extensively used in this code, but it can be added to enhance interactivity and functionality.
- Potential uses include animating elements, responding to user interactions, or fetching data from external sources.

File Structure:

- The code is organized into a single HTML file, with a separate CSS stylesheet.
- Images are stored in a designated folder, with clear file names and extensions.
- The resume is linked as a downloadable PDF file.

Best Practices:

- The code follows best practices for accessibility, including alt text for images and semantic HTML.
- The structure is modular, making it easy to update or add new content.
- The CSS is efficient, using classes and IDs to minimize redundancy.
